# üè† Real Estate Price Prediction

## üìñ Overview
This project builds a **real estate price prediction model** using various machine learning algorithms. The goal is to estimate property listing prices based on features like the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, maintenance fees, and size category.

## üìÇ Datasets
- **File:** `cleaned_real_estate_data_numerical.csv`
- **Features:**
  - `num_beds` ‚Üí Number of bedrooms
  - `num_baths` ‚Üí Number of bathrooms
  - `monthly_maintenance_fee` ‚Üí Monthly maintenance cost (in $)
  - `size_group` ‚Üí Property size category (e.g., small, medium, large)
- **Target Variable:** `listing_price` ‚Üí The price of the property

## üì¶ Installation
Before running the project, install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib lightgbm xgboost
```

If using a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # For macOS/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate     # For Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## üöÄ Running the Model
1. **Load the dataset**:  
   The script reads `cleaned_real_estate_data_numerical.csv` into a Pandas DataFrame.
   
2. **Train multiple models**:  
   - Linear Regression
   - Random Forest Regressor
   - Gradient Boosting Regressor
   - XGBoost Regressor
   - LightGBM Regressor
   - Neural Network (MLPRegressor)
   
3. **Evaluate performance**:  
   The script compares models based on:
   - **R¬≤ Score** (higher is better)
   - **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)** (lower is better)
   
4. **View results**:  
   The best model is selected based on performance metrics.

To execute the script, run:

```bash
python real_estate_model.py
```

## üìä Model Comparison Example
| Model               | R¬≤ Score | MAE ($) |
|---------------------|---------|---------|
| Linear Regression  | 0.72    | 45,000  |
| Random Forest      | 0.85    | 30,000  |
| Gradient Boosting  | 0.88    | 28,000  |
| XGBoost           | 0.89    | 27,500  |
| LightGBM          | 0.87    | 29,000  |
| Neural Network    | 0.75    | 40,000  |

## üîß Model Tuning & Improvements
- **Feature Engineering:** Add `price per sqft`, `location`, or `year_built` for better accuracy.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Use `GridSearchCV` or `RandomizedSearchCV` to optimize model parameters.
- **Deployment:** Save the best model using `joblib` and integrate it into a Flask or FastAPI app.

## üèÜ Best Model & Next Steps
- The **best model** is typically **XGBoost** or **Gradient Boosting**, based on accuracy.
- Future work includes **hyperparameter tuning** and deploying the model as a **web app**.
