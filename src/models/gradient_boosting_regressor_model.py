Real Estate Price Prediction using Gradient Boosting Regressor

This script loads a cleaned real estate dataset, trains a Gradient Boosting Regressor model,
and evaluates its performance in predicting listing prices.

Steps:
1. Load the dataset from a CSV file.
2. Define features (independent variables) and target (dependent variable).
3. Split the data into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets.
4. Train a Gradient Boosting Regressor model on the training set.
5. Make predictions on the test set.
6. Evaluate the model's performance using RÂ² Score and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).
